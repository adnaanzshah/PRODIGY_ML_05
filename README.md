# Food Image Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Overview

This project is focused on building a deep learning model that can recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. It leverages the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) to train and test the model, providing an automated solution for food recognition and calorie tracking.

## Dataset

The [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) consists of 101 different food categories, with 1,000 images for each category. This comprehensive dataset allows the model to learn from diverse examples and generalize well to unseen food images.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras. It processes the input images through multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, aiming to identify the food categories accurately and predict calorie content.

## Key Features

- **Input**: Images from the Food-101 dataset.
- **Output**: Predicted food category and estimated calorie content.
- **Tools**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras for the deep learning model.
  - Matplotlib for visualizations.
  - Kaggle’s Food-101 dataset for training and testing.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Download the Food-101 dataset**:
   Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) and place it inside the project directory in a folder named `food-101`.

3. **Prepare the dataset**:
   Ensure that the dataset is organized into training and test sets. Preprocess the images if necessary (e.g., resizing, normalization).

## Usage

Once everything is set up, follow these steps to run the model:

1. **Run the training script**:

   This script trains the model on the Food-101 dataset:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   During the training process, you will see output indicating the progress of the training, including accuracy and loss per epoch. The model will be saved after training.

2. **Evaluate the model**:

   To evaluate the model’s performance on the test dataset, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

   This script will load the trained model and run it against the test images, displaying the accuracy and loss values.

3. **Plot training results**:

   The script for plotting accuracy and loss over the training epochs can be run using:

   ```bash
   python plot_results.py
   ```

   This will generate and display plots showing how the model’s accuracy and loss changed over time during training.

4. **Prediction**:

   You can use the model to predict food categories and their estimated calorie content for new images. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python predict_image.py --image <path-to-image>
   ```

   The output will display the predicted food item and its approximate calorie content.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss on the test dataset. Although initial results show a low accuracy, with further tuning and optimization, the model’s performance is expected to improve.

Visualize the training progress and evaluate the accuracy through the generated plots.

## Next Steps

- **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve the model’s generalization.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust the learning rate, batch size, and other parameters to improve accuracy.
- **Advanced Architectures**: Experiment with deeper models like ResNet or EfficientNet to enhance performance.
